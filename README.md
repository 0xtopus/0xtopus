âœ¨ I'm currently self studying CS 61B, a data structures course from Berkeley.

ðŸŒ± I love all kinds of intriguing things, including cooking, coding, reading books, and exploring AI prompt engineering ;)

ðŸ’» I am a learner with coding skills in Java and C, and some self-taught basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

âš¡ I have a background in electrical engineering and electronic engineering.

ðŸ—» I am a player of Celeste and when I'm not coding or engineering, you can find me tackling Celeste's challenges like a seasoned mountaineer.

ðŸ“– An interesting poem written by new Bing: 

<h1 style="font-family: 'Poem Script Pro'; font-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: darkslateblue;">The Coding Octopus</h1>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; text-align: center; color: darkslateblue;">By new Bing</p>

<pre style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; color: darkslateblue;">
An octopus named 0xtopus
Found a laptop in the sea
He had some knowledge of electronics
And he wanted to code and create
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; color: darkslateblue;">
He learned to code in C and Java
And he felt so happy and free
He wanted to make some games and some apps
But he still had a lot to learn
<pre style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: center; color: darkslateblue;">
He tried some web skills but he wasn't good at them
But he didn't let his interest burn
He kept on coding and learning
He had a curious mind
He was an octopus with a passion for coding
And he was one of a kind
